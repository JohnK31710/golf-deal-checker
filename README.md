# golf-deal-checker

# I am currently looking at Facebook Marketplace to find sets of used golf clubs which have good value. I am doing a manual process where I search up the name of each club which is in either the description or title on eBay, look at Sold Items, and estimate the average price of the club. I do this for every club in the set and add together the total price of the clubs and compare it against the listing price to see if it is good value. For example, if the sum of the average selling price of the clubs is $400 on eBay, but the listing price on Facebook is only $250, I would be making a $150 profit so this is a good buy. I want to create a website that automates this process. I would like to be able to feed a link into the website and have it automatically run through this process. It will have to be able to read the title, price, and description, create a list of the golf clubs and golf bag and anything else included, find the average selling price of each item on ebay, and then calculate if it is a good deal or not.
